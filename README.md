**Theme:** Environmental

**Program Description - What is CleanScapes?**
- Allow the community to come together and determine the areas that need the most cleaning through a voting system.
- Gain better statistics on locations that tend to collect the most litter.
- Offer an opportunity for students to complete community service.
- Offer employment for those unable to secure part-time jobs in the current market (terrible btw).
- Target job insecurity and help clean our environment, all-in-one.

**Features:**
1. Priority List - Home Tab:
- This feature is showcased on the home tab, showing of a list of areas. The list is sorted by the highest priority to the lowest, with the highest being the location with the most votes.
2. Voting - Add Tab:
- This feature is showcased on the add tab, and allows the user to submit a vote for a location that they believe needs to be cleaned.
- The user will not allowed to be vote on a location that they have already voted for, if it still has not been cleaned yet.
3. Submit a Cleaning Claim - Clean Tab:
- If a user has cleaned an area, they may submit a claim for the location if it is on the priority list.
- If the location they selected only has 1 vote, and they are the only one who has voted for it -- they will not be able to claim it and the location will stay on the list.
- If the claim has been accepted, remove it from the priority list.
